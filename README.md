# Traffic-Violation-Detection-using-Ai
In this paper, we propose an improved background-updating algorithm by using wavelet transform on dynamic background, and then track moving vehicles by feature-based tracking method. A complete traffic violation detection system is realized in Python YOLO, OpenCV.
